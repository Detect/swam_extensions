When player sees that the shield at enemy base is taken, it will automatically start a countdown timer to when the shield will spawn again. Countdown timer is displayed under the flags captured at the top. It will also send shield timer updates to team chat. Disable sending shield timer to team chat using Mod Settings.

If auto-team chat is enabled, pressing `b` key will force stop the timer when it's active.
If auto-team chat is disabled, pressing `b` key will send current timer to team chat.
